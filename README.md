# CommuniTea
## A community by lolitas FOR lolitas.

Due to widespread misconception, people who wear lolita fashion have nowhere to share photos on the internet without being harassed and fetishized. CommuniTea solves this problem with an extensive vetting process during registration that only allows users who pass 100% to access the rest of the site! That may seem like overkill, but anyone truly passionate about the subculture will find the quiz exceptionally easy. In addition, all database endpoints require proper approval, authentication, and authorization, so EGL enthusiasts no longer have to worry about creeps stealing their photos. 

This project was fully deployed via Uffizzi, but unfortunately their service has since closed.

Unfortunately, due to the confidential nature of this project, instructions on how to run it will not be given, but a full demo can be requested any time. Contact me via email at mnmccoy95@gmail.com !
